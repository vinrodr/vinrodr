ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @vinrodr

I am a Lawyer and Social Scientist with a postgraduate degree in Public Management and a master's degree in Political Science. I was a CAPES postgraduate fellow, conducting research on municipal budget analysis and fiscal policy. With a comprehensive humanistic background and expertise in both quantitative and qualitative research techniques, I am dedicated to ongoing skill enhancement. My approach involves solving problems through data-driven insights and implementing effective, scalable solutions. 

Proficient in R, Python, SQL programming, and handling large datasets, I also specialize in georeferenced solutions. My focus extends beyond academic and profissional pursuits; I am also devoted to contemplating solutions that address social and economic inequalities.
